# Scala---Daily-Coding-Problem
Daily Coding Problems provided by https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/ and solved in Scala

I'll try to solve all the problems in functional style, if you see a more functional way of solving it, don't hesitate to comment or contribute :)

There is a chance that you find some problems where I use mutability (vars), apologies for that.

I hope this repo will help some Scala developers to Ace the coding interviews
